description: Run the headless FluxDown server from the prebuilt Docker image, with Docker Compose, CasaOS/ZimaOS, and Unraid.
section: headless-server
order: 2
---

The fastest way to run the headless server is the prebuilt Docker image — no Cargo build, no separate Web UI build step. The image bundles the server binary and the Web UI, exposes everything on one port (`17800`), and persists its database, logs, and access token to a volume.

Image: `ghcr.io/zerx-lab/fluxdown-server` (tags: a specific version like `0.1.54`, or `latest`).

> Prefer a pinned version tag over `latest` for reproducible deployments.

## docker run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name fluxdown-server \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 17800:17800 \
  -v fluxdown-data:/data \
  -v /path/to/downloads:/root/Downloads \
  ghcr.io/zerx-lab/fluxdown-server:latest
```

- `/data` holds the database, logs, and the generated admin token — keep it on a persistent volume.
- `/root/Downloads` is the container's default download directory (`HOME=/root`); bind it to a host path you want files written to.

The admin token is generated once on first launch and printed to the container log. Capture it:

```bash
docker logs fluxdown-server 2>&1 | grep -i token
```

Use it to sign in to the Web UI and to authenticate the management API and MCP endpoint (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

## Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  fluxdown-server:
    image: ghcr.io/zerx-lab/fluxdown-server:latest
    container_name: fluxdown-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "17800:17800"
    volumes:
      - fluxdown-data:/data
      - ./downloads:/root/Downloads
    # environment:
    #   FLUXDOWN_DATABASE_URL: postgres://user:pass@host:5432/fluxdown

volumes:
  fluxdown-data:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs fluxdown-server 2>&1 | grep -i token
```

All environment variables from [Server Setup](/docs/en/headless-server/setup/) apply — most usefully `FLUXDOWN_DATABASE_URL` to point at an external PostgreSQL instead of the bundled SQLite.

## CasaOS / ZimaOS

FluxDown is published as a third-party CasaOS / ZimaOS app store, so you can install it with one click.

In CasaOS / ZimaOS: **App Store → Sources → Add**, then enter:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zerx-lab/casaos-appstore@gh-pages
```

Then install **FluxDown** from the store. Store source: [zerx-lab/casaos-appstore](https://github.com/zerx-lab/casaos-appstore).

## Unraid

An Unraid Community Applications template is available in [zerx-lab/unraid-templates](https://github.com/zerx-lab/unraid-templates). The Web UI is served at `http://[SERVER-IP]:17800/`.

## Exposing it safely

The image binds `0.0.0.0:17800` inside the container, mapped to the host. As with any headless deployment, the admin token is the only thing guarding full remote control — see the [reverse proxy & TLS guidance](/docs/en/headless-server/setup/) before exposing it beyond a trusted LAN.

## Next steps

- [Web UI](/docs/en/headless-server/web-ui/) — sign in and manage downloads from a browser.
- [API Overview](/docs/en/api/overview/) — automate the server from scripts or other tools.
